## **General Description**
**inLUMEN** is a DATAPACT tool that evolves traditional AI/ML/data pipeline design tools into AI agent-driven co-design environments. The story begins with simple visions (or intents) and context provided by the user.

In DATAPACT, the **intent** translates to the pipeline goal: both in terms of structure, use and compliance goals. The **context** is the input data, code snippets, artifacts, constraints/rules/requirements, and resources.

The user remains in control of the design, however supported by dedidated agents whose role is to make these visions come to life. inLUMEN materializes their intents by generating the pipeline steps as a directed graph, and gives recommandations on compliance-strengthening design choices.

Additionally, it generates deployment artifacts such as containers and workflow blueprints needed to simulate/run the pipeline. Provenance is given via tracking reports on decisions taken by the user and agents during the design process. 

## **Related Compliance aspects**
- Compliance by design
- Traceable decisions (provenance)​​

## **Main Goal/Functionalities**
- Co-design Intelligent Pipeline Design Editor (GUI with chat dialog window)
- Deployment Artifact Generation (Dockerfiles, YAML)
- Agentic AI Backend (agents assist with compliance-strenghtening design refinements)

## **Architecture**
The picture below shows the component in the DATAPACT architecture.

The current local deployment uses a simple gateway architecture. Frontend and CLI clients call only the backend gateway API; Neo4j, MinIO, and the OpenAI-compatible LLM provider remain behind the backend boundary.

## **Component Definition**
inLUMEN's core functionality is provided by LLM-powered agents that serve as helpful assistants in pipeline design, translating high-level business-level intents to pure AI/data pipeline design choices. inLUMEN agents reason on user intents and context, draw pipeline steps, and give recommandations according to compliance insights provided by the user or via tool integrations. They can also support deployment artitfact generation, making pipelines deployable. The chat dialog window enables human-machine interactions to co-design pipelines. inLUMEN integrates with external DATAPACT tools through public workflow and artifact APIs.

## **How To Install**
Tool is provided as a service.

### Detailed steps

Software Requirements:
1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/%20products/docker-desktop/) installed. 
2. Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

The custom version for DATAPACT is still under development. To try the current stable version, follow the installation steps below:

Step 1: Clone this repository on your computer. 

Step 2: Navigate to the cloned project directory.

Step 3: Optional but recommended: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust only the values you need.

The Docker setup derives frontend API URLs, Neo4J URI, and MinIO endpoint from the Compose service names, ports, and credential values, so you do not need separate `NEO4J_URI`, `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, or `VITE_*_API_URL` entries for normal local use. The backend sends permissive CORS headers by default.

Common values you may change include:
- `FRONTEND_PORT`, `INLUMEN_API_PORT`
- `INLUMEN_API_PUBLIC_URL` when the browser frontend needs to call a separate deployed backend URL
- `NEO4J_AUTH`, `MINIO_ROOT_USER`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`
- `NEO4J_MEM_LIMIT`, `NEO4J_HEAP_INITIAL_SIZE`, `NEO4J_HEAP_MAX_SIZE`, and `NEO4J_PAGECACHE_SIZE` if Docker Desktop has limited memory available
- `API_AUTH_TOKEN` for the gateway API and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation when Keycloak auth is disabled
- `AUTH_ENABLED` plus the Keycloak values when enabling authentication

For Keycloak SSO, set `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and configure `KEYCLOAK_JWKS_URL`, `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER`, and `KEYCLOAK_AUDIENCE` in the root `.env`. For a local Keycloak on port `8081`, the default frontend client values are `VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:8081`, `VITE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=inlumen`, and `VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=inlumen-frontend`. The same frontend still supports the embedded toolbox contract: when loaded in an iframe it waits for an `SSO_TOKEN` postMessage and infers the toolbox parent origin, so `VITE_TOOLBOX_ORIGIN` is not normally needed; it remains supported in `frontend/.env` only as a fallback for deployments that hide iframe referrers. Standalone frontend setups can also keep using `VITE_AUTH_ENABLED` and `VITE_INLUMEN_API_URL` in `frontend/.env`; Docker Compose derives those values from the root `.env` unless explicitly overridden.

Step 4: Run the following command to build the docker containers:
```
docker compose up --build
```

The default `docker-compose.yml` is optimized for local development and exposes Neo4J and MinIO inspection ports. Neo4J is available at `localhost:7474` and `localhost:7687`; MinIO is available at `localhost:9000` with console access at `localhost:9099`. You can override those inspection ports with `NEO4J_HTTP_PORT`, `NEO4J_BOLT_PORT`, `MINIO_S3_PORT`, and `MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT`.

For deployment/production-like runs, use the production compose file. It exposes only the frontend and backend gateway on the host; Neo4J and MinIO stay private on the Compose network:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up --build
```

For a deployment where the browser frontend calls a separately deployed backend URL, configure the root `.env` before building:

```
INLUMEN_API_PUBLIC_URL=https://api.inlumen.example.com
```

`INLUMEN_API_PUBLIC_URL` is passed to the Vite frontend as `VITE_INLUMEN_API_URL`, so browser requests go to the deployed backend instead of guessing from the frontend hostname. Use a full URL such as `https://api.inlumen.example.com`; for local testing, shorthand values such as `localhost:5001` are normalized with the current browser protocol.

You can verify the backend CORS preflight before opening the frontend:

```
curl -i -X OPTIONS "$INLUMEN_API_PUBLIC_URL/health" \
  -H "Origin: https://inlumen.example.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
```

The response should include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

Step 5: Wait for the stack to finish starting. The root compose file now:
- starts Neo4J, MinIO, the backend gateway, and the frontend together
- builds the `backend` service from the Python source under `backend/`
- mounts the frontend and backend source folders for development
- keeps graph and object storage logic inside the backend gateway instead of exposing adapter services
- connects the LLM agents to the OpenAI-compatible endpoint selected in the UI
- is set up to behave consistently on macOS and Windows through Docker Desktop

Step 6: Configure an LLM provider from the UI. Open `http://localhost:8080`, choose Settings, and create an LLM configuration with provider, base URL, model, and API key. The backend does not read LLM provider, endpoint, model, or API key values from `.env`.

For OpenRouter, use your OpenRouter API key after adding the provider key in OpenRouter settings. Short model aliases such as `gpt-oss-120b` are accepted by inLUMEN and normalized before the request is sent.

You can also use Ollama Cloud with base URL `https://ollama.com/v1` and an Ollama Cloud model such as `gpt-oss:120b`. For a custom on-prem service, select Custom / On premise and enter the OpenAI-compatible base URL, API key, and model name exposed by that service.

For the best macOS/Windows experience:
- use Docker Desktop with `docker compose`
- keep the repository on a local filesystem, not a network drive
- keep Git line endings as checked in; the repo now enforces LF for container-executed files

Note: building the containers may take around 5 minutes, please wait until Neo4J is fully started.  

Note: Once the installation is complete in dev mode, the local endpoints are localhost:8080 (frontend), localhost:5000 (inLUMEN backend gateway API), localhost:7474/7687 (Neo4J), and localhost:9000/9099 (MinIO). In production compose mode, only the frontend and backend gateway are exposed; Neo4J and MinIO stay private on the Compose network.

Note: To log into MinIO, use the configured root credentials from `.env`. For security reasons, change these values before using the stack outside local development.

## **How To Use**

To open the editor, go to `http://localhost:8080` by default, or the custom value you configured in `FRONTEND_PORT`. This will open the dashboard.

The frontend talks only to the inLUMEN backend gateway API on `INLUMEN_API_PORT`. That gateway owns graph and file orchestration through internal backend modules and keeps Neo4J and MinIO implementation details out of the browser and CLI contract. The frontend and CLI should use only `INLUMEN_API_PORT`.
LLM configuration metadata is also saved through the gateway by default (`VITE_ENABLE_REMOTE_CHATBOT_CONFIG_SYNC=true`); user-provided API keys remain browser-local and are never stored by the backend.

LLM agents use OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoints. Configure OpenRouter, Ollama Cloud, or a custom on-prem endpoint in the Settings dialog. The backend rejects LLM requests that do not include a browser-supplied LLM configuration.

API key handling:
- Provider API keys are entered only in the UI, kept in browser localStorage so they survive refreshes, browser restarts, and container restarts, sent to the backend only inside the specific LLM request payload, and are not saved by the backend `/api/chatbot-configs` endpoints.
- Do not run this browser-supplied key flow over plain HTTP outside local development; terminate TLS before the backend gateway in shared or production deployments.
- Backend logs intentionally report provider, model, and base URL but not the provider API key.

## **Gateway API and Swagger**

The gateway API is served by the inLUMEN backend API on `INLUMEN_API_PORT`, which is `5000` by default.

Required gateway API environment variable when `AUTH_ENABLED=false`:

```
API_AUTH_TOKEN=change-me-local-token
```

Local URLs:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:5000/docs`
- OpenAPI JSON schema: `http://localhost:5000/openapi.json`
- Health check: `http://localhost:5000/health`
- Readiness check: `http://localhost:5000/ready`

Swagger UI is enabled by default. Open `http://localhost:5000/docs`, enter a bearer token, then use the Swagger `Authorize` button or the pre-filled bearer auth to run live requests. The live schema documents both the integration-oriented `/api/v1/*` endpoints and the UI-equivalent gateway endpoints for canvas graph editing, file operations, pipeline version management, chat, and deployment artifact generation.

When `AUTH_ENABLED=false`, authentication uses a static bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_AUTH_TOKEN>
```

When `AUTH_ENABLED=true`, authentication uses Keycloak access tokens:

```
Authorization: Bearer <KEYCLOAK_JWT>
```

The API validates Keycloak JWTs with `KEYCLOAK_JWKS_URL`, checks `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` when configured, and accepts `KEYCLOAK_AUDIENCE` matches from the token `aud`, `azp`, or `client_id` claims. `/health` and `/ready` are public. The OpenAPI JSON and all `/api/v1/*` endpoints require the bearer token in static-token mode; UI-equivalent gateway endpoints require a valid Keycloak bearer token when `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and also accept the same header in local static-token mode. Invalid or missing tokens return `401` or `403`; validation errors return `400` or `422`; missing resources return `404`.

Example requests:

```
curl http://localhost:5000/health

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_AUTH_TOKEN_OR_KEYCLOAK_JWT" \
  http://localhost:5000/openapi.json

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_AUTH_TOKEN_OR_KEYCLOAK_JWT" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/v1/pipelines

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/pipelines \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_AUTH_TOKEN_OR_KEYCLOAK_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Remote patient monitoring","description":"Integration-ready pipeline"}'

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_AUTH_TOKEN_OR_KEYCLOAK_JWT" \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/workflows?include_download_urls=true"

  http://localhost:5000/api/v1/pipelines/pipeline-123/artifacts/argo-workflow.yaml

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/graph/nodes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_AUTH_TOKEN_OR_KEYCLOAK_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"properties":{"flow_id":"retrieve","label":"Retrieve","type":"input","x":100,"y":120}}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/simple_chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_AUTH_TOKEN_OR_KEYCLOAK_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_message":"Add a retrieval step and connect it to processing","canvas_graph":{"nodes":[],"edges":[]}}'
```

Available gateway endpoint groups:

- `Pipelines`: create, list, fetch, and list versions for the current design pipeline
- `Artifacts`: generate Dockerfiles with the configured LLM, then assemble Argo Workflow YAML deterministically from the pipeline graph and Dockerfile metadata
- `Workflows`: list available workflow metadata, associated pipeline IDs, version metadata, and temporary MinIO signed access URLs when files are available
- `Canvas Graph`: replicate UI node and edge creation, deletion, property updates, and position changes through the gateway API
- `Pipeline State`: fetch the current graph, overview metadata, and saved UI pipeline versions
- `Files`: upload, remove, read, and update node-attached files without exposing MinIO credentials
- `Agentic`: call the same chat and artifact-generation operations available in the UI
- `Settings`: save and manage LLM configurations; provider API keys are browser-local and are supplied per request
- `Health`: public liveness and readiness checks

The gateway API does not expose MinIO credentials. When file access is available through MinIO, responses contain temporary signed URLs only.
